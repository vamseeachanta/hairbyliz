                            <span>Elizabeth has been cutting my hair every 2 -3 weeks for the past 8 years.  If that doesn't speak volumes, check back in 8 months when she will have been cutting my hair for 9 years!

                            <span>Compliments speak for themselves! Just about everyday (seriously everyday) I get compliments on my hair. I am the adventurous type with my hair. No matter what color my hair is, or how long or short, I have always been pleased with Elizabeth's work. Complete strangers compliment me. One time a lady behind me in church loved my hair so much she asked where I had it done and she came in to see Elizabeth. Not only does Elizabeth do great work as a hairdresser, but she is a wonderful person. She gives back to her community and her country. Over the years, I have become friends with Elizabeth and I am proud to call her family. I highly recommend Elizabeth's Hair Salon.

                            <span>Elizabeth is an amazing hairdresser! She has been cutting & coloring my hair since I moved to Houston in July 2009. She is very inventive and creative. I was very lucky because Elizabeth was able to travel to Hawaii in July 2010 to do my hair for my wedding. She did an amazing job and made my wedding day even more special. She spent the extra time to practice doing my hair to make sure that it was exactly what I wanted. I will always look at my wedding pictures and be happy that Elizabeth was able to do my hair. She did a beautiful job.

                            <span>Elizabeth has been my beautician for many years. She always gives me a perfect cut and style. She is the absolute best at coloring - No one can top her on that! Her salon is cheerful, uplifting, and energizing as is her personality. She has shared many cultural delights from pupusas to missionary work experiences and always shows great love for others. She is the best! Always!

                            <span>Elizabeth's great hair services give us self confidence! Her ability to work with different styles and different types of hair is remarkable. Color, cuts, and styling are her trademarks.

                            <span>I wouldn't dream of letting anyone, but Elizabeth, do my hair. She always does exactly what I want, but she also has the creativity to know what would be best if i don't know what I want. If she ever decides to retire, I won't know what to do. Elizabeth is very professional and has a wonderful personality. Her salon is relaxing with a fun atmosphere. I highly recommend Elizabeth. Her staff is professional and creative too!

                        <div>
                            <span>I first met Elizabeth 17 years ago at Supercuts and no one has ever cut my hair since. She has always cut and styled my hair to perfection, while always being positive and making me feel extremely comfortable. Elizabeth is more than just a professional hairstylist. She is also a friend who I cherish, as well as an active volunteer for numerous charities within the domestic and international community. She knows her stuff when it comes to cut, color, style, and cosmetology. I would highly recommend Elizabeth for maintenance cut and style, as well as any functions you may have where you want to look your finest.

                        <div>
                            <span>Elizabeth is fabulous - On time, gives a great cut (on straight and curly hair), even pleases hard-to-please tween boys, who want long hair but have to look neat for school. Her salon has a relaxing atmosphere - lots of magazines to choose from, comfortable seating, big windows with lots of natural light, and always a smile from the staff. She is always busy but never overbooks - what more could you want from a stylist!
